Favicon Drawing Generator is a web page that people can easily "DRAW" their favicon (which is a shortcut icon that is displayed next to title of your browser). Instead of having pixel-filling that most favicon generate sites do, I would like to create analog feeling of drawing experience in a digital space.This is still on-going project. I will keep adding functions.


Basically, my site has three major function : 

1. draw
2. download (for uploading user's server)
3. submission(so that users can share their favicon drawings in public)



You can check out web site [here](http://favicon-drawing.herokuapp.com/)

## Next step
- make fully-functioned tools...
	- make square drawing -> pixel (?)
	- animation ?
- cursor! 
- maybe indication - for each steps
- preview window 
- download : resize problem

- share button
