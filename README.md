## Favicon Drawing Generator 
Favicon Drawing Generator is a web page that people can "DRAW" their favicon with analog feeling of drawing experience instead of filling 1 pixel by each. This is still on-going project. I will keep adding functions. 

You can check out web site [here](http://favicon-drawing.herokuapp.com/)
