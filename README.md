Favicon Drawing Generator is a web page that people can easily "DRAW" their favicon (which is a shortcut icon that is displayed next to title of your browser). Instead of having pixel-filling that most favicon generate sites do which I like a lot,but I would like to create analog feeling of drawing experience in a digital space.This is still on-going project. I will keep adding functions.


Basically, the site has three major functions : 

1. drawing tool with canvas
2. download (for uploading user's server)
3. submission(so that users can share their favicon drawings in public)



You can check out web site [here](http://favicon-drawing.herokuapp.com/)

## Next step
- make fully-functioned tools...
	- animation ?
	- path problem
- cursor!!
- maybe indication - for each steps â€“ make more user-friendly
- live preview window 
- download : resize problem
- facebook/ twitter share button
